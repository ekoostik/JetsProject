# JetsProject

## Description
This program takes in a text file and converts it into an array list. Five "Jets" are imported and stored into the array. A user can then select from a menu to perform an action, such as view information or even create a custom jet. 

## Tech Used

Java, Eclipse, Google, T and TA, SD37

## Lessons Learned

In this weeks homework I got a better understanding of the flow of information. 
I struggled quite a bit getting the syntax correct for importing the text file information. 
With some great help from the TA's I got through it. 
I understand the concept of Abstract classes and interface pretty well.
I find myself knowing where the information needs to go, just struggle with syntax. 
There could have been more creativity with implementing the interface and 
creating constructors with varying parameters. However, I wanted to be sure to 
first achive the requirements. By the time I did I was pretty burnt out.

I feel doing this weeks homework has taught me more than any single project so far.

I was happy that I was able to complete more without assistance this week. I found I spent 
less idle time overthinking and more time experimenting. 
Very motivating.
